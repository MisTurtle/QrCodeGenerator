This project was created in a few hours for fun. More features will probably be added in the future, and here is a list of ideas to add:

* Native support for popular logos (X, Discord, Github, Reddit, ...)
* Option to automatically add a background to transparent logos
* Export with transparent background
* Add a frame to the QR Code
